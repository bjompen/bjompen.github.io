# DevOps without dev?

```Quote

I feel it in the water.
I feel it in the earth.
I smell it in the air.

For quite a while I have spent most of my reading time, most of my work time, and a lot of my spare time, evangelising the DevOps movement. I see it as one of the biggest revolutions in work place structure I have ever heard of, but I am often met with scepsis.

This, as most people who read, think, or consider work structures, know, is expected - however I have found that the problems I meet very often does not relate to DevOps itself, but a diference in what DevOps means to me and others.

### First - A disclaimer

There are about as many different opinions of what DevOps is as there is people who ever uttered the word "DevOps".
This rant is based on my interpretations.

Lots of it is also, just like with all work ideologies, stolen from other strategies like Lean, Scrum, and so on.

## But lets start with some background...

```Quote
The Road goes ever on and on
Down from the door where it began.
Now far ahead the Road has gone,
And I must follow, if I can..
```

I started my workdays in tech many years ago, working my way from support, to config, to backoffice, to systems engineer and so on. Quite a standard journey for a techie I would say.

Somewhere along the trip I got caught up in automation, driven by a will of not wanting to do things twice.

I stumbled across some different ways of working, like ITIL, Scrum, and so on, but they never stuck to me.

I first came in contact with DevOps through the State of DevOps report. Something caught my interest as it seemed to focus more on the people, and the work result was more of a consequence. As with many others I read The Phoenix Project and The DevOps Handbook, and came to the conclusion that results, be it code or products, was always the easy part. The hard part is figuring out the why.

Which leads me to the problem:

**I dont work with development**

*"What? Björn, hasn't the powershell community been saying this for a long time: We are all developers!"*

Yes, but the gap between the DevOps movement and traditional IT is still huge.

(Oh, and for clarity and honesty, I actually do work with developers quite a lot..)

## Back to the DevOps Movement

```Quote
One Ring to bring them all..
```

```Quote
DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users. The contraction of “Dev” and “Ops” refers to replacing siloed Development and Operations to create multidisciplinary teams that now work together with shared and efficient practices and tools.
```

In my social media feeds lately i have seen terms like "DevSecOps" (or is it "SecDevOps"?), and "DevSalesOps" (Yes, really).

The problem with this, I believe, is that both security and Sales should have been a part of this from the start. Just like most writings about DevOps states, DevOps is not a group or a department. You can't create a "DevOps group" that "do DevOps" and expect things to be done. Hence, I believe, we could not just combine developers and operations and be done with it.

## People, Process and Products - In that order!

```Quote
Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky
```

* DevOps' first focus is about the people. Enable your people to be the best they can, grow as much as they can, and trust them with the knowledge of what's best for their part of work.

* DevOps' second focus is the process. What we do in everyday life. Making our work visible for others to see, seeing our work as part of a greater structure, and making the result of our work available to our end users.

* DevOps' third focus is the products. What is a product if not the result of a process done by people? Some people write code which results in software, but it might as well be a new computer, a form where a department manager can order onboarding of a new employee, or a fruitbowl on the table in the kitchen every monday. (Products might, of course, also relate to the programs we use in everyday life to achieve the previous goals, but for this rant I choose to exclude this interpretation as it is not important right now.)

Notice anything interesting about this?

There's no need to mention developers or ops anywhere.

The main focus of a lot of DevOps evangelism seems to focus on getting products out of the door as fast and stable as possible.

This is of course great! If you can release the latest and greatest result of your product in seconds that is amazing!

But it should not be the focus of DevOps. It's a consequence of it.

## How to talk to your dog about DevOps

```Quote
I want to be a healer, and love all things that grow and are not barren.
```

Before I get into what could sound a lot like pure negativity I would like to mention some ways I believe even the simplest IT department can use the principles of DevOps to become a fantastic place.

### Work on your soft skills (People!)

* Talk! Be it by the coffe machine, at lunch, or in the office space, allow people to interact. Tell everyone what cool stuff you're working on right now. Listen to what others find interesting. This not only spreads ideas, but also happiness. People love to talk about what interests them.

* Ask. Have back office ever sat down with your front desk to see what they are really doing? Have you ever looked at how HR does things? When you picked your versioning tool, did you first check if the documentation team needed one? Make sure you include everyone before you make a decision. The easiest way to do this, I find, is back to talking and showing your way of work.

* Trust. How many times have we said "IT would be so much easier without end users".. IT's reason of existance is to allow end users to do their job, so who can better tell you what they need but them? When an end user asks for something, try to understand the problem she or he is facing. Ask her why and how long this problem has existed, and if it can be tied in to another person or departments work. Understanding is the key to trusting each other.

### What is my job really? (Process)

* Learn your processes. Start watching the people around your work. Where do you fit in? Instead of seeing software installation as your job, try to see the lifecycle - who handles licensing, who is running the software, what is the goal of the end user's work? Can I make the flow of work better by knowing how my peers act?

* Visualize. A Good IT department is virtually invisible to the workplace, yet they do a quite a lot. Make sure all the cool stuff is presented in one way or another. A display in front office showing statistics? This week we have upgraded the ERP system, made n+1 sales, and each result saved billing dept. 10 minutes of work. What is the goal of the company, and how do your work fit in to that process? That is what you should show off! (But please, don't do the weekly statistics mail.. We already get enough mail as it is!)

### Actual tech improvements (Products)

* Automate what is possible. "But we never install the same server twice! This one does x, that one does y, completely different!". Do they have an OS? Automate the installation. Do they have Firewall baselines? Automate. Break every piece of work down to the least common denominator and start there.

* Kill your darlings. Once you see your place in a process, you can start looking at the work you're doing that is unnecessary. Yes, loads of the things we do every day is not for anyone's profit, but because it's the way it is done. Is there a product you can buy that solves something you do? Calculate ROI not just in money, but in saved time, and above all: worker happiness!

### And remember the feedback loops!

* The only way to actually know if what you are doing is useful is to ask the people around you. Should we improve on something? Are we heading in the direction people need us to go? In poker there is a saying: It's never to late to fold. Even if you invested a lot of time in something we need to know if it is worth keeping alive, and we need feedback loops to get this information.

  When I say feedback I do not only mean feedback on the end result. Ask your colleagues what they think you did right, and what can be improved. Ask your manager how he sees you and your work as a part of the companies main goals.

  In fact, before you start doing any work at all, make sure you know who to ask for feedback.

## The death (and rebirth) of DevOps

```Quote
PIPPIN: I didn't think it would end this way.

GANDALF: End? No, the journey doesn't end here. Death is just another path, one that we all must take. The grey rain-curtain of this world rolls back, and all turns to silver glass, and then you see it.
```

So where does this take us? I believe one of the main problems of DevOps adoption lies within the name itself.
If I dont work with Dev, I dont need DevOps, right? Theres only Ops left, and that's what we're already doing, right?

Wrong - We just need to kill "DevOps".

What started as a way to unite the people and processes towards a common goal of great results ended up beeing discussions about who could build the most effective CI/CD pipeline and the most automated tests. We forgot the people outside dev Dev and Ops department, and instead of removing the walls we simply moved them a bit to the sides.

You see, even if my company doesn't sell, or even develop our own software, we still need the human side to work, and we still do work with processes, and there is a result product beeing delivered. We just need to find it.

Unfortunately I don't have a silver bullet. I don't know a better name than DevOps.

Some time ago only people using "real" programming languages like C or Cobol were called developers. Now we call people who automate their work using scripts, be it PowerShell, Python, or Go, developers.
Maybe it's time we broaden the meaning of a developer to include anyone who develops anything at all.

Maybe that way I can finally talk to anyone about the amazing future I see in a world of DevOps.
