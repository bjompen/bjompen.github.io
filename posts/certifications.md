# A follow up on the concept of certifications

Feedback is an amazing thing. I like most kinds of feedback.

- Negative feedback, as long as it is constructive ("I didn't enjoy this because xyz. Could we try this instead?"), is great and lets me improve the things I do.
- Positive feedback, such as "This was a good experience and I learnt a lot!" makes me happy and realize I am on the right path.
- Improvement feedback. "Can we try changing to xyz?" Maybe it will change the way we see the world, maybe not, but trying is a learning experience.

But there is one thing that stands out:

> You inspired me!

My previous post series, [Let's learn some Azure! Az204](posts/az204.pt1.md), seems to have hit home. I have heard at least three people saying it inspired them to get started with certifications, and it almost makes me cry of happiness. It's one of those things I will never get used to. It's... humbling, and I wish to thank each and every one who says it.

I also got an interesting question from [Emil Larsson](https://mastodon.nu/@ehmiiz@infosec.exchange) about the certification:

![Would you recommend it?](../images/certifications/ehmiiz.png)

I honestly have never given this much thought before, and I realized there are so many levels to certifications that it actually deserves its own post.

So here we are ğŸ™‚

## The many reasons for certifications

Primarily I think there are three reasons for getting a certificate, and you probably fall in to one or more of them:

- Your job requires it.
- Your CV looks good from it.
- You want to see if you know your stuff.

That's the easy and logical part. Looks good, no downsides, right?

Well I am not 100% convinced, and we need to discuss both sides.

## Your job requires a certification

These are not to common in Sweden, but it exists. One of the reasons a workplace may require a certification is that Microsoft actually has bonus programs based on this. If your company wants to achieve "Partner status" it needs [a number of qualified certificates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/solutions-partner-azure#skilling).

The backside of this is that it may also include things you, quite frankly, aren't interested in. 

And I don't mean that in the "it may be boring" way, but in the costly one.

If you, like me, have issues with studying to start with then studying stuff you don't really care about is even harder. The result of this is you needing more time for studies, but also harder to succeed with the tests, which increases costs, and so on.

Now this may be ok if work has bottomless economies, but I have had places where the expressed standard was "You get one try, if you fail you have to pay to retake it".

I never took the test at that place. I changed jobs.

## Your CV looks good from it

This is probably the weirdest one, and the one we really need to discuss.

I have been on the hiring end not many times, but it has happened. Getting a CV with a couple of certificates tells me.. Absolutely nothing.
The only thing a certificate tells me is that you know how to study and take tests. Really.

![Let's play a game...](../images/certifications/game.png)

> Pick your favourite subject you learned in school. Now think of a test you had in that subject. One specific test.

You cant? I know I don't remember one single test I ever took. I Still passed school. (well yes, barely, I had absolute shit grades, but that's another post). Sure, chances are you learn topics and subjects _surrounding_ this, but the test results _does not show skills_

In fact, there is even a chance for the opposite result.

If your CV looks like this then I'm going to start wondering why you can't hold down a job..

![a loooong list of previous jobs](../images/certifications/CV.png)

And the same goes for certificates: If you have them all I will start wondering if you ever do anything but study. 

Because yes, studying is good and important, but without _actual_ experience it means nothing. Hell, chances are the portal layout, and the ARM API has changed since you took the test anyway, so nothing is where it was "back then".

### On the other hand...

A list of certifications _may_ also mean you are so good at what you do you literally just go in and do a test and get it over with. It may say you are the best at what you do.

The problem is that the only way for me to know this is if I know you.

This means that if you, for example, combine a long list of certificates with public speaking, or blogging, or in any other way making it verifiable that you _do_ know things, then this long list of certificates may actually make your CV look good.

So in the end I would say when it comes to your CV:

> Think of what you _want_ to show, and what message it will send to the person reading it. Instead of just adding the certification shield, maybe add a session or post next to it that verifies your interest and which subtopics you find interesting. In some cases, just like it may help you removing some employers, it may even help _not_ to have every certificate on your CV, both to prevent ending up where you don't want to be, but also to instead emphasize what you are proudest of.

## You want to see if you know your stuff

This is probably the only true reason to take a certificate that doesn't necessarily come with a downside: Instead of taking the test _to get the certification_, you use it the way this post started: As feedback.

Because it will give you good feedback on what topics you know, and where your skills may lack.

But here's the kicker: You don't need a certification for that. Just take the practice exams, and go through the learning material, and you will get the same results.

And it is not entirely true that there are no downsides because taking the actual exams costs money. Fortunately, every now and then Microsoft does events that lets you do a free exam, most common in connection to [Microsoft Build](https://build.microsoft.com) (Which was where I got my Az-204 certification attempt from) or [Microsoft ignite](https://ignite.microsoft.com).

## Summary

To sum it up, certifications may be a double edged sword. Like so many other things it depends on how you use them and who sees them.

Am I proud of my certifications? You bet your !"%& I am. I studied hard, played around in Azure, and spent years trying to get them.

And I failed. I failed so many certification attempts. Because they are hard.

And I don't remember most of the things I learnt, because most of it are things I don't use on a daily basis.

And this is what I have to remember, and what I have to consider when bragging. It is one thing to post a LinkedIn update saying "Look at my new certification", but the usage may differ on the use case.

But don't get me wrong: I do recommend getting certified, just do it for the right reasons. For yourself. For the bragging rights. And for the shields.

And keep an eye on Microsoft's free giveaways. Who knows, it may be a gateway drug.

Oh, and If you are curious in any way about certifications, have questions, want a mentor or someone to talk to, don't hesitate to contact me. After all, there is nothing I love more than hearing that magic phrase:

> You inspired me!
