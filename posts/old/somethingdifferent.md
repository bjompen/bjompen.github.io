So, I named this blog 'A blog about things and stuff.'
It´s time for something other than powershell.

Apart from Code I do have a lot of interests,
the biggest one being music.
I listen to it, play it (Guitar, bass and whatever else i can get my hands on) and even run my own home studio.

And today one of my bands released our new album!
<a href="https://sliptrickrecords.com/this-time-necrophor-are-reborn/">Necrophor - Reborn</a>
On this particular album I play the bass, background guitar, Keyboard, and some additional battery.
Was thinking of doing vocals as well, but I had to leave something for the rest of the band :)
Jokes aside, a huge thanks to my fellow musicians,
Henrik 'Hempa' Eriksson - Vocals
Mikael 'Strampan' Strandberg - Drums
Henrik 'Henrock' Larsén - Guitars
And of course, the magician behind the mixing desk,
the man, the myth, the legendary
Thomas Skogsberg, Sunlight Studio - recording and mixing.

So, it is with great pride I give you Reborn.
