I've been away for a screen-detox vacation for a couple of days. Camping, fishing, and spending quality time with the kiddos in the Swedish mountains is good for the soul.

Unfortunately, it is not good for my time planning. I'm a notorious time enthusiast, and I am kind of realizing I have to speed up the training in order to make it through before the test.

This is made even better by the fact that I am leaving for [Wacken open air](https://www.wacken.com/en/)

It's all worth it though, with views like this

Anyhow, let's continue and see how far we make it. I may skip a few chapters of blogging for the sake of time, but by now you should understand kind of how I think anyways.

Of we go.

## Container registries, Instances, and Apps.

This next part is on three different, yet connected services: ACR, ACI, and ACA.

Starting with the easiest to explain and mostly interconnected one

## ACR - Azure Container Registry

ACR is a container registry, built on the Docker registry tech. To put it simply, it is a storage technique for storing Docker files.

As it is fully [OCI](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/spec.md) compliant you can use it for some other things as well, such as Helm charts, or Bicep configurations.

ACR comes in three tiers, Basic, Standard, and Premium. The big differences is in throughput and storage space, and Standard is the recommended "default". Premium does add some nifty security features such as private networking which could be useful to remember as well.

ACR also has a set of tasks it can run to automatically do things like updating images or run docker commands on a schedule or a manual or pipeline trigger. This pretty much lets you run docker commands without having to have a docker runtime locally installed.

But the important parts of ACR comes when you connect it to other services, such as

## ACI - Azure Container Instances

There are a lot of ways of running container workloads on Azure, all with different goals and different abstractions on top. ACI is one of the simpler ones.

The short description would be a docker container host with everything abstracted away from you. You push a docker image to ACI either locally, or from a connected container registry such as ACR, and it will run that image. If you need static storage you can use an Azure file share, and you can set some basic variables and settings in the docker container. It also supports multiple container images in a group.

That's pretty much it. Docker in the cloud. It can be really useful in combination with for example AKS to scale instances, or in dev/test/prod setups, but for now let's keep it simple. After all the most advanced one is coming up...

## ACA - Azure Container Apps.

ACA is a somewhat less abstracted, and somewhat more flexible solution. It is built on top of Kubernetes, but with lots of the Kubernetes advanced stuff hidden. You might see it as a step between ACI running simple instances, and AKS running the super advanced where you need to configure every detail.

It comes prepared for interacting with any type of [KEDA](https://keda.sh/docs/2.11/scalers/) scaling solution, and also has built in support for [Dapr](https://docs.dapr.io/concepts/overview/) sidecars. I would say one important thing to know is what Dapr can help you with, as this is an important part of selecting the right container solution for a project, so here goes..

Dapr is a standardized solution of APIS to help developers solve things like pod inter communication using pub/sub solutions, logging, bindings for input and output, secrets management, and more. It adds "hidden" containers that takes care of this so that you as a developer can focus on developing your things.

Setting up ACA also needs you to create a container environment. The environment takes care of the grouped settings for a set of container apps, such as for example the Dapr component configurations, file mounts, and more. They act as a boundary of a group of containers or pods.

A container environment can be tied to one or more container apps, which is the actual running image or images. The app takes care of scaling this particular set of images or creating new revisions of images when updated. You can also add specific sidecars to a container app.

Another big feature worth remembering is built in authentication and authorization. You can easily set up your container app to require authentication and use AAD, Facebook, OpenID, GitHub and more. when this is set up you get an authentication container magically created authentication pod where all ingress traffic is passed through, and it injects authentication data in to the headers of your packages, again allowing for less developing external solutions, and more focusing on your app.

## Summary.

As noted this is a shorter post. Like I said, I am running short on time and need to work on my time management skills.
Tomorrow I need to pack my bags for Wacken, but I hope to make it through a test exam as well to see if I have improved my results a bit, and then we'll see when I get back how far and deep this series goes.

Until then!
