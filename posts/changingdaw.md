# So, I recently switched DAW

I have been a long time user of Logic (9) on my MacBook, and really like it, but there was trouble growing in studio bjompen...

See, I have a [M-Audio ProFire 2626](https://m-audio.com/products/view/profire-2626). It's big, has all the ins and outs, and works perfect for my needs.

- make somewhat descent sounding demo recordings
- enough inputs to record a drum set (8 mics)
- small(ish) enough to hide in a wardrobe when not used.

I've recorded a number of demos on it, with various results. [Some of them released](www.tautriadelta.com), some not.

### But...

- It runs on firewire only.
- There are no new computers with firewire.

I know there are adapters you can buy that lets you use a new Mac with FireWire, but there has been a number of issues with the ProFire and adapters.

Similarly, there are a number of known problems with the ProFire and FireWire PCI cards, which makes using it on a PC near impossible.

Last, but not least, M-Audio stopped supporting this thing with drivers somewhere around OSX 10.6-10.7

### In the end I realized there were to many problems.

- My MacBook is old and falling apart
- Macs are bloody expensive
- If I buy a new Mac, I get no FireWire
- No FireWire and no drivers means I have to buy a new audio card
- New OSX versions doesn't support Logic 9, so I would have to learn a new DAW no matter what.

### When I'm not a musician...

...I work mainly with windows computers. The result is I have a number of those, and quite good ones as well, so I decided to take the big leap and stop using Mac.

Since I already have computers with i5 and i7 processors, 32 gig ram, and a ton of disk...

...Problem number 1 solved.

- No new computer needed.

### Make some noise

The ProFire can be set to use as a ADAT slave. What does that mean? Instead of using the audio card part of it, you can daisy chain more than one card using optical cables, and the ProFire simply sends the digital signal to another audio card.

The point of this is simply to extend your card with more inputs.

So If I can find a card that supports ADAT in, I can still use my old card, and therefore I don't require as many inputs.

Problem number 2 solved.

- Make sure new card has ADAT in and USB connection to old computer.

### the solution to all (well, two at least) of my problems

I ended up buying the [Audient iD14](https://audient.com/products/audio-interfaces/id14/overview/)

It's really small, has two analogue XLR inputs with phantom power, USB connection, lot's of knobs and blinking lights, and most importantly:

ADAT in using optical cable.

the 14 in this series indicates the number of ins and outs, so this particular model has 4 outputs, and 10 inputs, where 2 are built in, and 8 external.

And my ProFire gives me 8 external.

### Software?! Where we're going we do.. oh

Last but not least, I needed a new DAW.

Honestly I have no big demands on my recording software, but there are some things that weighs in to the decision

- Simplicity. When recording I should more or less just press record.
- Simplicity again. Things like 'adding a drum track', or 'changing tempo mid song' should not require a lot of work.
- Compatibility. I use a couple of free plugins, and want to continue to use them.
- Price. I'm not a rich man.

I have heard a lot of good things about [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/) and decided to try it out.

### Press record on tape

My first experiences with Reaper has been fantastic. It took me less than 30 minutes to be up and running, recording my first guitar tracks. Some things worth noting though.

- I started Reaper first time before I installed the Audient. This made the audio settings wrong, but it was really easy to set correct through the "options - preferences" menu.
- At first my VST plugins didn't show up. It turns out the path to the folder Reaper created for user plugins weren't correct. Again, "Option - preferences", added the path and it works.

All in all, getting started with reaper was as good as can be!

### The end takeaways

So, did I achieve my goals? other impressions?

- The iD14 was a breeze to install and get working, sound from the built in preamp is nothing short of fantastic, and the build quality of this thing is far above its price level. I paid about 250$ for it

- Reaper got me started really fast. 
  - The download is just a few megabytes! seriously.. how do you fit an entire DAW in this size!
  - The price for reaper is really good for home users. 60$. Bonus! Full version in evaluation for as long as you need! 
  - Remote control using a browser from internal network (which was the main reason this post was done üòÅ)
  - Loads of really good built in plugins, and a really active community that builds more of them.
  - Cross platform! This works on Windows, Mac, and Linux!
  - All my plugins work fine
    - [LePou](https://vst4free.com/dev/258/) guitar plugins
    - [Manda Audio PowerDrumkit2](https://www.powerdrumkit.com/), free and awesome drum kit.
    - IR's from [Soundwoofer](https://soundwoofer.com/Library/Index) and [Kalthallen](https://shop.kalthallen.de/?page_id=423) (Hey Markus, we used to hang in the Katatonia forums!)

So in the end, instead of a new Mac and a new big audio card, I paid about 200$ for everything, and is up and running again.

I still have a lot to test and try (like daisy chaining the M-Audio), but I'm really looking forward to trying and testing this new setup.

And maybe, sometime, write another rant about it.
